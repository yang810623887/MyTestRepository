# PlottingGL Module

The PlottingGL module provides processors for plotting DataFrames with OpenGL functionality. Among other things it contains a scatter plot, a scatter plot matrix, a parallel coordinate plot, and both 2D and 3D axes.

The Plotting Module is necessary for providing the data structures, i.e. the DataFrame.
