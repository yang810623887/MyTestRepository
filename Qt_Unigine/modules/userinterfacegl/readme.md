# UserInterfaceGL Module

This module contains a selection of various processors providing on-screen interfaces for user interactions within an OpenGL canvas. For example, it includes a widget for camera manipulation (Camera Widget), widgets for volume cropping (Cropping Widget), and a presentation mode (Presentation Processor).

The Presentation Processor can be used, e.g. during demonstrations, as it allows to show images in a PowerPoint fashion instead of its regular image input.

The [Assimp](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/) library is used for handling the meshes used in the widgets.
