// This Bloom Pass is inspired by the bloom pass of the Unreal Engine. It creates a mip map chain of
// bloom textures and blur them <br>
// with different radii. Because of the weigted combination of mips, and since larger blurs are done
// on higher mips this bloom <br>
// is better in quality and performance.
